this is a project for CS5296

Introduce

This is a project about mining virtual currency using AWS. There are two main sections, mining bitcoin using Quarkchain and mining Ethereum using different EC2 instances.

IMPORTANT: Please use your official AWS account instead of your student account.

For bitcoin, we used the PyQuarkchain code on Github. https://github.com/QuarkChain/pyquarkchain.
Methodsï¼šCreate EC2 instance. then, SSH connection. Next, run the CD command to enter the Pyquarkchain file. And run the commands in Script1.txt successively in the terminal.

For Ethereum, after SSH connection, use script2.txt on your terminal. Please refer to the Report for specific methods.

New research and solution: 
we propose a new solution. Time series analysis was applied to the digital currency itself to help miners determine when it was a good time to mine using EC2 instances of AWS. 
Run the CD command to enter the code file. you will see bitcoin.ipynb. run  it. Finally, you will see a output like predict.png
